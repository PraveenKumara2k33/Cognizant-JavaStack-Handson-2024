# Schedule forthcoming Match
## Description


### Objective:

To work with JavaScript Functions, validation, and Date object.

#### Problem Description:

Richard and his friends plan to find their upcoming cricket matches. Also, they want to know whether their matches fall on weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Help them by writing a JavaScript program to display the day of the upcoming cricket matches, which is given as input.

Function displayDay(matchDate) should display the day of their upcoming cricket matches. Here, the `'matchDate'` argument represents the match date. 


If the matchDate is not a valid date, the method returns the error message `"Invalid date. Please provide a valid date."`

If the matchDate is a valid date, the function adds additional information to the message to indicate that it is a weekend match if the match falls on a Saturday or Sunday. The message returned by the function should be `"The cricket match is scheduled on <day>, which is a weekend.`" If the match is on a weekday, the function should return the message `"The cricket match is scheduled on <day>."`



**Note:**

(i) You may verify the correctness of your function by invoking it from within console.log

(ii) Date format should be `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
