Description

Objective:

To work with control structures.

Scenario:

Anand is a proficient student in mathematics. He is fond of the number series. He thinks of logic critically and tries to find a series of it. You, as a Java programmer, code his logic to find the Square Increment Sequence that he wants to create. 

Constraint: 

Display only the first 10 numbers of the series. 

Note:      

In the sample input and output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.      

Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.      

Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.      

Adhere to the code template, if provided   

Please do not use System.exit(0); to terminate the program.

   

Sample input and output: 1

Enter the first number 

5 

Required Square Increment Sequence

26 37 50 65 82 101 122 145 170 197 226 

{Explanation:   

26 is 5*5+1 

37 is 6*6+1 

50 is 7*7+1 

65 is 8*8+1 

82 is 9*9+1 

101 is 10*10+1 

122 is 11*11+1 

145 is 12*12+1 

170 is 13*13+1 

197 is 14*14+1 

226 is 15*15+1
