# Babithaâ€™s App
## Description

### Objective:

To work with collections.

#### Scenario: 

Babitha, an experienced typist, conducts daily practice tests for her students to enhance their typing skills. Each day, students compose a paragraph based on a given article within a specified time limit and submit it to Babitha for evaluation. Babitha emphasizes the use of specific special characters like `, ; : . ? ! @ # $ %` in the submitted paragraphs, as these characters help to split words in a sentence. `Any other special characters are considered part of the word itself`.

- To assess the students' performance, Babitha meticulously counts the total number of words used in each paragraph and tallies the count for each individual word. Based on this detailed analysis, she provides feedback to her students.
- As the number of students increases, Babitha encounters challenges in manually processing and analyzing each student's paragraph. To streamline this process, she seeks to automate the analysis by developing a Java program. 
- The program should display the words used in each paragraph, along with the number of times each word appears, in lowercase and sorted alphabetically.    


**Note:**

- The output should be alphabetically sorted and presented in lowercase.
- In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output. 
- Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
- Ensure to provide the names for the classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description
- Adhere to the code template, if provided.
- **Do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the code.**
