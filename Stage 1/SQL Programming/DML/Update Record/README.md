## Description
### Objective:

To work with the update table.

#### Description:

Refer to the given schema. Assume that the book table has been already created.

In a bustling library system, the librarian receives a notification regarding a specific borrowing record labelled `'BR001'`. Upon inspection, they notice that the borrower has returned the item after the due date.

To maintain the system's integrity and ensure fairness, write a query to update the borrowing record, setting the `return date to '2023-02-27' and applying a fine of 25.00 to the borrower's account`.
