In the realm of digital marketing analytics, Claire, a data analyst for an e-commerce platform, is tasked with investigating user engagement patterns across different email service providers. She suspects that users with Yahoo email addresses might exhibit distinct behaviours compared to users with other email providers.

To gain deeper insights, write a SQL query to extract user information such as `user id, name, and gender,` specifically on those with `'yahoo' email addresses`.

Sort the records based on the `user id in descending order`.
