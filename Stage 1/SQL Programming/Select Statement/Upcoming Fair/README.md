Upcoming Fair

Description

Objective:

To work with the select statement with the where clause.

Description:

Since the 'Fiction' and 'Mystery' genres are the main focus of the next fair, Sarah wants to construct a query to select the ISBN, title, author, and publication date from the database that fit into these categories. 

Sort the records based on the ISBN in descending order.
