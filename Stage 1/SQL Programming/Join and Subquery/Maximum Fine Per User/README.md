# Maximum Fine Per User
## Description
## Objective:

To work with subquery.

#### Description:

Write a SQL query that fetches details like `user ID, username, and the maximum fine amount paid by each user`. Give an alias name for `maximum fine as max_fine`.

If the user has `borrowed any book`, then display the `maximum fine amount`; `otherwise, display the maximum fine amount as null`.

The results should be `sorted in descending order` based on `user id`.
