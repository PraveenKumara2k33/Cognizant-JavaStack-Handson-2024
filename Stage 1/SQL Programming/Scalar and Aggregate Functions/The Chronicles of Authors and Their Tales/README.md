# The Chronicles of Authors and Their Tales
## Description
### Objective:

To work with the aggregate functions.

#### Description:

In the vast library of literary wonders, there exists a realm where prolific authors reign supreme, their tales weaving intricate narratives that captivate readers far and wide. Among these storytellers, some have carved their names into the annals of history with a multitude of published works.

In order to identify such authors, you need to write an SQL query that displays the names of the authors who wrote at least two books as well as the number of books they have written. The total number of books is given an alias name of total_books.

The result should be sorted in `descending order based on total books`.
